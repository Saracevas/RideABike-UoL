# RideABike@UoL
## About
RideABike@UoL was a university project where I was tasked with creating a bike sharing Android application that is powered by a server using sockets.

## Features
1. The app allows users to register, login, preview their accounts and top up their balance.
2. Users can see all of the availalbe stations around the city, as well as see the statuses of bikes in each individual station.
3. Users can choose a starting road and a destination and the application will calculate the fastest route from A to B.
4. Users can then rate a particular route. This data is collected can later be used to offer more convenient routes to other users.
